Pre-Course Week 4: Intro to TDD and Pair Programming

Fizzbuzz is a simple coding challenge, where the objective is to create a program with the following specification: 

1) The program can be passed a number.

2) When passed a number that is a multiple of 3, the program returns the message 'Fizz'.

3) When passed a number that is a multiple of 5, the program returns the message 'Buzz'.

4) When passed a number that is a multiple of both 3 and 5, the program ignores the previous 2 rules and returns the message 'Fizzbuzz'.

5) In all other cases, the program simply returns the given number.

This exercise was carried out to introduce TDD and pair programming.
